Hi Sir Ross,

Here's the app details:

- login via social media
- tictactoe using reactjs

Home - "localhost:8000"
Login - "localhost:8000/login"
Tictactoe Game - "localhost:8000/tictactoe"

Django built in Admin Panel


Missing part is the PVP for the tictactoe game using websocket.

I just have limited time to do this app, since I'm really loaded in my work right now.
I did stopped on the module for checking who's user is online and offline "localhost:8000/tictactoe/users" so thats it.
Anyways I've learned that python is really  something that i should learn, a high level language for rapid development.
